Multiplayer Territory Painting Game – Write-Up

This project is a real-time multiplayer territory-painting game where several players share a large canvas 
and compete to cover the most space with their assigned color. The inspiration comes from simple territory-capture 
games like Paper.io, but this version is built to be lightweight, easy to play, and focused on live player interaction.

When a user logs in, they choose a name and enter a shared canvas where all other connected players are visible. 
Each player receives a unique color and appears at a random starting location on the board. Movement is controlled 
with the arrow keys. As a player moves, they leave a trail of color behind them, and every tile they step over becomes 
painted in their color. The board updates instantly for every player in the session.

The game encourages interaction because players constantly overwrite one another’s territory. Any color that a player 
paints can be taken by someone else, so the board naturally evolves into a competitive battle for space. Players often 
run into each other’s areas, try to take over open regions, or race to cover fresh territory. Because the canvas is shared 
and updates in real time, every action affects every other player.

A live leaderboard is displayed on the side of the game screen. It shows each player’s name, the color assigned to them, and 
the percentage of the entire canvas they currently control. The leaderboard updates continuously as players move and repaint tiles. 
This creates a sense of competition even without formal scoring or elimination mechanics.

To play the game, the user simply logs in, enters the canvas, and starts moving with the arrow keys. There are no time limits, 
no winning conditions, and no deaths or resets. The experience is open-ended and entirely driven by competition for territory. 
The goal is to paint more of the board than any of the other players currently online.

From a technical perspective, the game uses an HTML canvas for drawing, along with a Node.js and Socket.IO backend to manage real-time 
communication. The server keeps track of all player positions, colors, and painted tiles. Updates are efficiently broadcast to all 
connected players so that everyone sees the same board state. The project is deployed using Docker on an Azure virtual machine. The game 
remains active as long as the server is running, and the board persists until the server is restarted.
